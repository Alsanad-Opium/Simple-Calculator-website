## **Description**

This project is a browser-based calculator application designed to handle basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
The project was created to showcase the integration of a Flask backend for hosting static files and a client-side JavaScript implementation for real-time calculations. It emphasizes simplicity, functionality, and responsive design.

### **Why I Created It**  
- To create a lightweight web application showcasing seamless interaction between a Flask server and frontend technologies.  
- To provide users with a basic, interactive calculator accessible via a browser.  

### **Problems It Solves**  
- Offers a responsive and intuitive interface for performing arithmetic operations.  
- Runs efficiently on any modern web browser without requiring backend processing for calculations.

## **Features**
- Perform basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.  
- Input validation for accurate calculations and error handling.  
- Lightweight and efficient, running calculations entirely in the browser using JavaScript.
