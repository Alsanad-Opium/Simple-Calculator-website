# **Simple Calculator**

A simple and user-friendly web application that performs basic arithmetic operations, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Python Flask** for hosting.

----------

## **Description**

This project is a browser-based calculator application designed to handle basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
It was created to showcase the integration of a Flask backend for hosting static files and a client-side JavaScript implementation for real-time calculations. The application emphasizes simplicity, functionality, and responsive design.

### **Why I Created It**

-   To create a lightweight web application showcasing seamless interaction between a Flask server and frontend technologies.
-   To provide users with a basic, interactive calculator accessible via a browser.

### **Problems It Solves**

-   Offers a responsive and intuitive interface for performing arithmetic operations.
-   Runs efficiently on any modern web browser without requiring backend processing for calculations.

----------

## **Features**

-   Perform basic arithmetic operations:
    -   Addition (`+`)
    -   Subtraction (`-`)
    -   Multiplication (`*`)
    -   Division (`/`)
-   Responsive design for various screen sizes.
-   Input validation for accurate calculations and error handling.
-   Lightweight and efficient, running calculations entirely in the browser using JavaScript.
